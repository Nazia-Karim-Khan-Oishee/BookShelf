# Overview

This project was developed as part of our DBMS-II course during the 4th semester. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate our proficiency in managing relational databases and applying various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on them. Through this project, we aimed to showcase our understanding of relational database concepts, including but not limited to normalization, schema design and integrity constratints.

We used bootsrap as our CSS modules that helped further improve the presentation of our website and helped ensure responsiveness.

Javascript was used as the requirement of this project was that no frameworks could be used for client-side or server-side scripting. But we did use JQuery for better responsiveness.

Also Php was used due to the same constraint

The database used was mySQL as it was recommended to use a SQL database(relational)

We used xaamp to help manipulate these components with phpmyadmin to manage the mySQL-based database.
